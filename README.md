# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles + computer (Mac) setup scripts. Feel free to take a look and copy stuff you find suitable.

Main content is in the 3 scipts:

* `init_new_machine`
* `install_apps`
* `link_dotfiles`

One can either run each one of them as a script or source and use the helper functions as part of something else.

How to:

1. `git clone git@github.com:Nipsuli/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles`
2. `EMAIL=<your email address here> ./init_new_machine`
3. `./install_apps`
4. `./link_dotfiles`
