My personal dotfiles + computer (Mac) setup scripts. Feel free to take a look and copy stuff you find suitable. I'm also open for suggestions for improving this setup!

How to:
* git clone this repo
* `EMAIL=<your email address here> ./init_new_mac`

Stuff:
* Scripts linted with [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).
* Trying to follow Google's [Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)
* Tested manually in virtual box with the help of [this](https://github.com/myspaghetti/macos-virtualbox) setup script.
